NULL, the function bring the bot name from the environmental
variable "R_telegram_bot_name". You can pass another bot's name

\description{
This function set up what is necesary to \code{\link{telegram.bot}}
package to be used in a more easy way by the function provided by
the depigner.
}
\details{
Before you can use the \code{\link{depigner}} facilities (or the
\code{\link{telegram.bot}} ones) to use your bot to chat whith
Telegram from R, you have to set the bot up.

To set up a bot in telegram, find \code{@BotFather} on telegram. Send
the message \code{\\start} to it, and then send the message
\code{\\newbot} to it too. Next you have to follow the very simple
istruction it gives you. At the end of the process, save your bot
token and never share it publicly!!

After your bot is created, go to your bot default chat profile and
send the message \code{\\start}.

Now you can return to R and put both the bot's name and token into
the .Renviron file. To access to it you can use
\code{\link[usethis]{edit_r_environ}} which will open the `.Renviron`
file, ready to be modified.

You need to insert two lines, namely the one for your bot's name:

`R_telegram_bot_name=<name_of_my_bot>`

and one for its token:

`R_TELEGRAM_BOT_<name_of_my_bot>="1234567879:AbcDeF_GH1IlM_nmoP2rSTUvzyABCDefG5"

Next, restart R and you are ready to use al the (simple)
functionality of the \code{\link{depigner}} package, or the flexible
and complete ones from the \code{\link{telegram.bot}} package.
