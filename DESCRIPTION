Description: Pigna [_pÃ¬n'n'a_] is the Italian word for pine
    cone.  In jargon, it is used to identify a task which is boring,
    banal, annoying, painful, frustrating and maybe even with a not so
    beautiful or rewarding result, just like the obstinate act of trying
    to challenge yourself in extracting pine nuts from a pine cone,
    provided that, in the end, you will find at least one inside it. Here
    you can find a backpack of functions to be used to solve small
    everyday problems of coding or analyzing (clinical) data, which would
    be normally solved using quick-and-dirty patches. You will be able to
    convert 'Hmisc' and 'rms' summary()es into data.frames ready to be
    rendered by 'pander' and 'knitr'. You can access easy-to-use wrappers
    to activate essential but useful progress bars (from 'progress') into
    your loops or functionals. Easy setup and control Telegram's bots
    (from 'telegram.bot') to send messages or to divert error messages to
    a Telegram's chat. You also have some utilities helping you in the
    development of packages, like the activation of the same user
    interface of 'usethis' into your package, or call polite functions to
    ask a user to install other packages. Finally, you find a set of
    thematic sets of packages you may use to set up new environments
    quickly, installing them in a single call.
