# depigner (development version)

* Fix a bug, caused to an updated version of `as_tibble`, that prevent
  to variables names used in `summary()` to be showed when passed to
  `tidy_summary()` (#17).
* To avoid collision with `{usethis}` namespace itself, `use_ui` now
  use its own `R/utils-depigner.R` template which incorporate the 
  roxygen2 comments to update the `NAMESPACE` by depigner. Currently
  this is used to activate the `{usethis}`' User Interface functions
  only (fixes #18).
* Fixed a typo in `use_ui` that prevents it to work correctly (#18).

# depigner 0.8.1

* Changed `installed.packages()` using `find.package()` to speed up 
  the evaluation considerably, especially when thousand of packages are
  installed into the system. In the `README`'s example is still used
  `installed.packages()` because that example have to know all the 
  names of the installed packages.
* Changed `\dontrun{}` with `\donttest{}` in the examples which can 
  "run" but should not be tested. Telegram's related examples and the
  `use_ui()` one still report `\dontrun{}` because they require special
  environments (Telegram configuration and package-like project) to be
  executed without errors (#16)

# depigner 0.8.0

* Reduced cyclocomp up to 15.
* Improved and execute `if (interactive())` only, the `gdp()` examples.
* Removed `{usethis}` interface for message startup to make it able to
  be suppressed.
* Added `imported_from()` function to get the list of imported packages
  by a package.
* Changed interface to package installers and sets of packages.
  Introduced `pkg_*` sets, changed `check_pkg()` to `install_pkg_set()`,
  exported `please_install()`
* Updated `README` including a table of contents, some badges, and
  reordering the sections
* Moved `fs` to Imports
* Added dependencies from packages `{lattice}`, `{survival}`, and
  `{Formula}`, which `Hmisc` depends on (require for checks).
* Fix `{progress}` reference into `README`.
* Isolate `use_ui()` from unexported functions of `{usethis}` package.
* Reformat `DESCRIPTION` purging some unused imports dependencies, and
  rewriting pkg title and description accordingly to the new
  corresponding entries in the `README`
* Fixed a typo in the call of the generic `tidy_summary()`, and refactor
  it `tidy_summary.summary.formula.reverse()` method.

# depigner 0.3.1

* Update `ubesp_pckg` (#4).
* Update `ubesp_pckg` (#5).

# depigner 0.3.0

* Introduce dependency from R >= 3.5 because of the package **mvtnorm**
  which is in the tree of **rms** and **Hmisc** and depends on the
  version of R 3.5.
* Moved **survival**, **rms** and **Hmisc** from Imports to Suggests.
* Added `start_bot_for_chat()` function, `send_to_telegram()` generics
  with methods for string and ggplot plots, and not exported
  functionalities as a wrappers to the main functions of the
  **telegram.bot** package.

* Remove dependencies from **vcd** package.

# depigner 0.2.0

  for categorical variable accordingly to the number of groups, in a 
  suitable way to be used in the **Hmisc** `summary()` with
  `method = "reverse"`.
* Added `paired_test_continuous()` function to implement paired test
  for continuous variable accordingly to the number of groups, in a 
  suitable way to be used in the **Hmisc** `summary()` with
  `method = "reverse"`.

# depigner 0.1.0

* Some variable names updated.
* Bug fixed in `summary_interact()`.
* Add some tests.
